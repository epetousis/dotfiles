## How to install

Install GNU stow. Then, clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles`. Then, run `cd ~/.dotfiles && stow *`.

You'll also need to [install vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) before opening nvim.

You'll probably want to [install Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#installation). The manual and Homebrew installations are supported.
